## Linear Regression Analysis:

R-squared (0.723): This value indicates that approximately 72.3% of the variation in the vaccine dose rate can be explained by the death rate. This suggests a substantial association between the two variables.

MSE (0.001): This low value suggests that the model has a small error term, indicating good model fit and prediction accuracy.


## Hypothesis Testing:

The primary objective here would be to test whether the coefficient of the death rate in the linear regression model is significantly different from zero.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The death rate has no effect on the vaccine dose rate.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The death rate does affect the vaccine dose rate.

Statistical significance is typically evaluated using a p-value. A p-value less than a chosen significance level (commonly 0.05) would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

## Bayesian Theory:

This approach would involve specifying a prior distribution reflecting initial beliefs about the relationship (which could be non-informative or based on previous studies) and then updating this distribution with the observed data to obtain a posterior distribution.
The posterior distribution would give a range of plausible values for the effect of the death rate on vaccine dose rates, along with probabilities for these values.
