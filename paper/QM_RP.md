# Investigating the Key Factors Influencing COVID-19 Vaccine Dose Rate: A Comprehensive Data Analysis Approach

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to global health systems,
emphasizing the crucial role of vaccines in controlling the spread of the virus.
The "Covid-19 Case Study" provides a framework to study the relationship between COVID-19 death rates and vaccine dose rates. The research could explore if higher mortality rates in certain areas lead to increased vaccine acceptance and uptake.
My individual research aims to identify key factors (demographic, death rate, etc.) influencing COVID-19 vaccine dose rates, whether a single variable(death rate) plays a significant role in this case.

## Objectives

- To analyze the correlation between demographic factors and COVID-19 vaccine dose rates.
- To examine the impact of COVID-19 death rates on vaccine uptake.
- To identify other significant determinants affecting vaccine dose rates.

## Methodology:
The research will employ a multi-faceted data analysis approach, utilizing techniques from Urban Spatial Science and Data Science. Key methodologies will include:

1. Data Collection: focusing on vaccine distribution, demographic details, and COVID-19 impact metrics.
	 - COVID-19 weekly announced vaccinations
	 - Deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate
	 - Demographic related data
2. Statistical Analysis: initial data processing and exploratory analysis.
	 - Data extract
	 - Data clean and plot
3. Modeling: developing predictive models to identify the most influential factors affecting vaccine dose rates.
	 - Linear regression (each factor to vaccine dose rates)
	 - Multi-linear regression (multi factors to vaccine dose rates)
	 - Visualization

## Expected Outcomes:
The research aims to provide a detailed understanding of the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine dose rates. This will aid in formulating targeted strategies for improving vaccine uptake and exploring what affects vaccination rates.
